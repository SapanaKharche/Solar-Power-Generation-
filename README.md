# Solar-Power-Generation-
As documented in the given notebook, I conducted a thorough examination of solar power plant data. Initially, I loaded the required libraries and datasets, including generation and weather sensor data for both Plants 1 and 2. I confirmed that date-time formats were consistent across datasets and translated categorical variables for simplification. The records were combined and unnecessary columns were deleted, with an emphasis on critical features like as ambient temperature, module temperature, irradiance, and power output. Visualizations like line graphs and scatter plots were used to investigate the correlations between variables.In addition, I used correlation analysis and feature engineering to prepare the data for model training. Linear regression models were used, both with and without scaling, to estimate AC power production, providing insights into model performance indicators such as RMSE and R-squared. Furthermore, I used XGBoost to improve model performance and evaluated its impact on prediction accuracy. The analysis also included a comparison of power output from various solar arrays within each plant, which identified inferior performing arrays based on average daily power yield and irradiance. Overall, the research included data pretreatment, exploratory analysis, model development, and performance evaluation, which provided important insights into solar power generation dynamics.
